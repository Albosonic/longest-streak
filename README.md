## The goal:

The goal of this project is to create an application that takes in user typed input, and uses good UX (up to you) to display the longest "even" or "odd" streak of letters.
Evenness for the letters alternates with a = even, b = odd, c = even, d = odd etc.

A few gotchas:

- Whitespace neither counts for a streak, nor breaks a streak
- Non-alphabetic characters including numbers break a streak
- Capitalization does not matter

Underneath the displayed string, please put the total streak count

Here's an example of what a finished product could look like. Feel free to make it your own:

Please use React/Typescript on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The frontend should be responsible for displaying the content and functionality, while the backend should do the actual calculations.

Make sure to include a README with instructions on how to get your app up and running locally.
